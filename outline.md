# Learning how to learn

## Outline

* Why is this important?
  + The Internet is only 25 yrs old
  + Our industry is just an infant compared with other industries
  + Lots of churn, and we're the source of innovation (thinking & tech)
  + Our #1 skill is to be able to learn new tech and be productive quickly

* Two phases of learning
  + Initial concept
    - Structure and relationships
    - Associate it with something we already know (metaphors, stories, etc)
  + Increasing comfort & productivity (for effective recall)
    - Repetition and struggle
    - Find the right level of struggle
  + Be wary of what _feels_ like effective learning

* Adopt a learning mindset (perspective)
  + Awareness is crucial (mindfulness)
    - Emotions
    - Inner dialogue
    - Object of attention
  + Embrace the struggle
  + Grit/tenacity is what sets you apart
  + Curiosity is what keeps you going
  + Continuous improvement (feedback)

* Strategies for learning
  + Videos for overviews and context
  + Tutorials for a model of what is common
  + Rewrite an existing project
    - No need to think about the domain
    - Have an existing solution to model (be wary of pattern pitfalls)
  + Write a new project that you need (or really care about)
